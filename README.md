# turtle_race

This interactive game experience is made using OOP, randomization, and the turtle library. It has special features such as the turtle that is in first place is biggest and a racetrack as the background with a start and finish line. It is random on which turtle will win(each turtle moves a random distance each time), so may the odds be in your favor!
